# Transfer Repository Ownership to alonbreitz-droid

## Repository Transfer via GitHub Web Interface

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Visit: https://github.com/ZombieDuckling/ashlee-motors/settings
2. Scroll down to the **"Danger Zone"** section at the bottom

### Step 2: Transfer Ownership
1. Click **"Transfer ownership"** button
2. Enter the new owner username: `alonbreitz-droid`
3. Type the repository name to confirm: `ashlee-motors`
4. Click **"I understand, transfer this repository"**

### Step 3: New Owner Accepts
- `alonbreitz-droid` will receive an email notification
- They need to accept the transfer
- Once accepted, the repository will be under their account

## After Transfer

**New Repository URL will be:**
`https://github.com/alonbreitz-droid/ashlee-motors`

**Important Notes:**
- All collaborators will remain
- All issues, pull requests, and history will be preserved
- The repository URL will change
- Update any CI/CD or deployment configurations that reference the old URL

## Alternative: Make alonbreitz-droid Admin

If you want to keep ownership but give full admin access:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ZombieDuckling/ashlee-motors/settings/access
2. Find `alonbreitz-droid` in collaborators
3. Change permission to **Admin**

This gives them full control without transferring ownership.
